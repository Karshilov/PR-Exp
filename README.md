### KNN

+ KNN Classification based on public dataset
  + Use K-D Tree to solve the KNN problem
  + Javascript version(in KNN/vision/index.js) has a higher time complexity than cpp version because I'm too lazy to optimize it.
  + The reason why I use Javascript instead of Python is that I'm not familiar with data visualization in Python
